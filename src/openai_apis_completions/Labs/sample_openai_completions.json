It is an open source language developed by the Mozilla Research Lab and backed by a vibrant open source community. Rust emphasizes safety, speed, and concurrency. It is designed to be a practical language that provides memory safety without a garbage collector and fast performance without sacrificing safety. Rust also enables low-level memory manipulation, giving developers the freedom to implement more efficient algorithms and data structures. Furthermore, Rustâ€™s type system and its strict compile-time checks help catch and prevent many kinds of bugs before they can occur. Rust is suitable for a wide range of use cases, from embedded systems to web backends.",
